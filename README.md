**Stop guessing. Start forecasting.** Our AI system analyzes 8+ years of historical cardamom market data, weather patterns, and 39 market variables to predict optimal procurement timing — saving you money and reducing risk.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge

Cardamom is one of the world's most expensive and volatile spices. Prices can swing **±15% within weeks** due to:

- 🌧️ **Monsoon weather disruptions** across Kerala & Karnataka growing regions
- 📦 **Supply chain bottlenecks** at auction houses and distribution hubs
- 📈 **Speculative trading** on Indian commodity exchanges
- 🌍 **Global demand fluctuations** from Middle Eastern and European importers

**Traditional procurement relies on:**

| ❌ Old Approach | ✅ Our Approach |
|---|---|
| Experience-based guessing | Data-driven AI predictions |
| Manual price tracking in spreadsheets | Automated 30-day rolling forecasts |
| Reactive buying (chasing trends) | Proactive entry-point identification |
| High financial risk & overpaying | Risk-scored recommendations |

> **Result:** Procurement teams overpay by thousands annually, miss optimal entry points, and face unpredictable costs that wreck budgets.

---

## ✨ Our Solution

A **comprehensive AI forecasting platform** that predicts Indian cardamom prices 30 days in advance, identifies optimal buying opportunities, and delivers actionable procurement strategies.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔮 **30-Day Price Predictions** | Daily forecasts with confidence scores, risk levels, and buy/wait/accumulate recommendations |
| 📊 **Multi-Currency Support** | View prices in USD, SAR, INR — built for international procurement teams |
| 🎯 **Smart Buy Signals** | AI identifies "STRONG BUY" windows when prices dip below trend equilibrium |
| 📈 **Interactive Visualizations** | Price trend charts, risk heatmaps, confidence gauges, and distribution breakdowns |
| 📄 **Executive Reports** | Export 4-page PDF reports with analysis, charts, and recommendations for stakeholders |
| ⚡ **Real-Time Analysis** | Upload your own market data and generate custom forecasts within seconds |
| 🧪 **What-If Scenarios** | Simulate 9 adjustable market parameters with 4 preset scenario templates |
| 💰 **Cost Calculator** | Estimate savings from optimal procurement timing vs. average market prices |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Our system combines **advanced machine learning models** with **statistical analysis** trained on real Indian cardamom auction data to deliver accurate, actionable forecasts.

### Data Sources

| Source | Coverage | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Historical Prices** | 2018 – 2026 | 2,869 trading days of auction data |
| **Weather Patterns** | Temperature, rainfall, humidity, soil moisture | Kerala & Karnataka growing regions |
| **Market Activity** | Supply volumes, demand indicators, auction quantities | Indian Spice Board data |
| **Seasonal Trends** | Week-of-year, day-of-week, cyclical patterns | Multi-year seasonal decomposition |

### AI Engine — Triple-Model Consensus

Our proprietary forecasting engine leverages a consensus approach across three specialized models:

| Model | Architecture | Specialization |
|---|---|---|
| **TimesFM** | Foundation time-series model | Long-range trend detection & seasonal patterns |
| **LSTM-CNN-34** | 34-layer deep learning hybrid | Short-term price dynamics & volatility modeling |
| **XGBoost-v17** | Gradient-boosted ensemble | Multi-factor regression across 39 market variables |

**How consensus works:** Each model generates independent forecasts. The system combines them using confidence-weighted averaging — models that agree strongly produce higher confidence scores, while disagreement triggers risk flags.

### Analytical Techniques

- **Exponential Moving Averages** → Adaptive trend-following that weights recent data
- **Weighted Linear Regression** → Momentum detection and price trajectory modeling
- **Mean Reversion Analysis** → Identifies when prices deviate from equilibrium values
- **Volatility-Adaptive Bands** → Dynamic confidence intervals based on market conditions
- **Day-of-Week Seasonality** → Captures recurring auction-cycle patterns

### Output

Every forecast delivers:
- **30-day price trajectory** with upper/lower confidence bands
- **Daily recommendations** — STRONG BUY / BUY / ACCUMULATE / WAIT
- **Confidence scores** ranging 60–95% depending on model agreement
- **Risk classification** — Normal vs. High Risk days
- **Optimal entry date** with expected savings percentage

> *All predictions are probabilistic. Market conditions can change rapidly. This system is designed as decision support, not a guarantee.*
